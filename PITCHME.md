### Coffee With A View

---
## What Are We?

We allow the user to find a place to grab a coffee, and then head over to a nearby scenic view to enjoy it at. With the help of Google Maps, Yelp, and Flickr we've used the power of location so that you can find a sip and a relaxing spot wherever you are.
